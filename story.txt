þThis is a story about a robot who wanted to realize his potential as a professional
chef. People constantly told him: "You are a robot! You can't even taste anything!" But the robot knew he was destined for greatness because he wasn't just an ordinary robot. He was created by Gordon Ramsay, one of the greatest chefs in the world. Robot did not need to know how to taste when he could apply perfect precision that he had learned when implementing a binary search tree for his programming class. ^X
