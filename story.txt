þThis is a story about a robot who wanted to realize his potential as a professional
chef. People constantly told him: "You are a robot! You can't even taste anything!" But the robot knew he was destined for greatness because he wasn't just an ordinary robot. He was created by Gordon Ramsay, one of the greatest chefs in the world. Robot did not need to know how to taste when he could apply perfect precision that he had learned when implementing a binary search tree for his programming class. 

For a binary search tree, robot still do not know how to test. However, robot can know the taste of the food via some secret method. Therefore, people try to find the way how robot can know the taste of the food without eating food. Scientists use as many method as they can to figure out the problems. Finally, they use the implementation of red black tree to find the solution why robot know the taste without eating.

The glory that was red black tree, with the choice of only two branches at a time, it created and recorded the great complexity of human perceptions. One may think it was just emulating the tasting, however after some more stunning features that were unleashed by red black tree displayed, the course of history changed hitherto.  

With the superior time complexity of the Red-Black tree, the robot was finally able to cook a good meal. He stored endless combinations of flavors and how their combinations would be perceived by the human taste buds. His master, Gordon Ramsay, often called him a donkey. But who is the donkey now?
